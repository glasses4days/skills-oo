What are the three main design advantages that object orientation can provide?

    Polymorphism:
        This is the writing of code that allows for bits of code to be interchanged.
        Instead of writing something that is one time use or being repetitive, things 
        can be reused or apply to a greater number of things.

    Encapsulation:
        This means that we keep classes and the methods that apply to them are all kept in the same place. 
        From an organizational view, this seems to make things very easy to read and easy to change. 

    Abstraction:
        The use of encapsulation leads to the ability to hide details of the inner workings of code that
        one doesn't need the details for. This is abstraction. 

What is a class?
    A class is data structure that holds methods and attributes that can be applied to multiple instances. 
    It also allows us to intentionally structure inheritance.s


What is an instance attribute?
    An instance attribute is a class attribute that only applies to a specific instant of that class.

What is a method?
    A method is a function that is applied to a specific class. 

What is an instance in object orientation?
    In oo an instance is a single occurence of a class. 

How is a class attribute different than an instance attribute? Give an example of when you might use each.
